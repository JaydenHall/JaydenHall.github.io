    <h1>What is emotional intelligence</h1>

    <p>Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions
        of others.
        Emotional intelligence is generally said to include at least three skills: emotional awareness, or the ability
        to identify and name one’s own emotions; the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like
        thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes both regulating one’s own
        emotions when necessary and helping others to do the same.</p>

    <h2>The difference between EQ and IQ</h2>
    <p>IQ is a number derived from a intelligence test.
        <ul>This will test you on:
            <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
            <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
            <li>Working memory and short term memory</li>
            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
        </ul>
        EQ is a measure of a person’s level of emotional intelligence. This refers to a person’s ability to perceive,
        control, evaluate, and express emotions.
        <ul>EQ is centred around these abilities</li>
            <li>Identifying emotions</li>
            <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
            <li>Controlling one’s own emotions</li>
            <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
            <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
            <li>Relating to others</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Why is EQ important</h2>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is important for both your personal life and for your career.
        A higher understanding of emotional intelligence helps you with decision making, stress and to relate with your
        coworkers.
        Humans and inherently emotional people and just because you are at work does not mean you can just switch them
        off. Working in teams is an important part of what well be doing as developers, being aware of your own and
        others emotions will help. People with higher EQ are also more adaptable to change.</p>
