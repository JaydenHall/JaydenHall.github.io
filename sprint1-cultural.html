    <h1>Values and Identity</h1>

    <h2>Core Values </h2>

    <h2>Ethical Decision </h2>

    <p>Background:
        Early in my career as a personal trainer I would do regular up-skill courses. Some provided by the club and
        others by industry leaders.
        I attended a workshop from someone that runs a business that helps teach new personal trainers how to build
        their business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Situation:
        One word they continued to use was “trick”. “This is how we are going to trick …… into signing with us”, which
        never sat right with me. The last section of the course was on price presentation. For anyone that’s never been
        a personal trainer this is everyones least favourite part.
        The main takeaway was the first price you give your prospective buyer should always be an over inflated one.
        That way if they reject your first offer you are able to then give them a large discount and make them feel good
        or they sign up for that price and your a big winner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Decision:
        The temptation when starting out is to do anything it takes to get clients, no money is guaranteed let alone the
        fact you need to pay the gym $200 a week before you turn up. I chose to set my rates and only offer that price.
        Honesty between myself and my clients is key to results. I felt starting off with a lie was not the relationship
        I wanted. While clients may never know this sort of thing goes on it always helped me feel confident and trusted
        with my clients. </p>


    <h2>How has culture influenced my identity</h2>

    <p>Growing up sports was a huge part of my life. I am very competitive and love to win, “at the cost of everything”
        -my partner. Competition is always something that excites me and I have stayed active my whole life. Over the
        years playing in sport, I have developed leadership qualities that I would have never seen in myself.
        My friends have always been important to me and our relationship has had a massive impact on me. Having a core
        group you can trust has given me confidence and helped me grown as a person. It's good to know you have people
        in your corner rooting for you, they’ll also let you know when getting a little ahead of yourself.
        My partner has made a huge impact. I would have ideas and never follow through, she has been the one to give me
        the confidence to go after what I want and to trust myself.</p>


    <h2>Strength & Limitations</h2>


    <h2>Evaluating my Strengths and Limitations in terms of my learning and career development</h2>

    <p>I see myself as honest and direct. When I am focused on a task I will make sure it get done. When something is
        important to others i'll always be careful and responsible.</p>

    <p>I often get caught up with doing what is right and not what is best. If the rules are rules I find it hard to see
        the other way even when the situation calls for it.
        At time this can lead to stubbornness, I know I need to be more open to change.
        Another area I would like to work on is procrastination. I put things off to long but long the feeling once I
        get something done.</p>


    <h2>Identifying which of my strengths might help me in my learning and how they might intersect with learning
        obstacles</h2>

    <p>One of my key strengths I believe will help me in my learning is my dedication and focus to the task at hand.</p>
