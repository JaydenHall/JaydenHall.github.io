        <h1>Learning Reflections</h1>

<h2>My Long Term Goal or Career Pathway</h2> 

<p>My goal over the next six months is to finish the EDA and have found a job in IT.
In 18 to 24 months my partner and I had planned to move to Europe (COVID-19 pending) for a year or so to work and travel.</p> 

<p>A significant part of choosing to become a developer was the contracting option. This would allow me to work while I travel. I also have my sights set on becoming a contractor when I return to New Zealand. This would mean I could work 6-9 months in the year and also allow me to spend my extra time working on property development, as that is another big passion of mine.</p> 


<h2>The human skills I want to develop in my time at EDA</h2> 

<p>As this is an entirely new environment for me - that being learning, corporate and working in a team/with others. I would like to work on corporate communication, networking and being more attentive to others I’m working with.</p> 

<p>I would also like to develop more patience with myself, particularly when I am not adapting or picking things up as quickly as I had anticipated or would have liked.</p> 



<h2>A Description of my Strengths and Limitations</h2>

<p>When it comes to my strengths and weaknesses, I know for a fact that I am very process driven, committed, controlling.

I see these as both strengths and weaknesses when relating these to my learning journey. I know that I will never give up and always deliver the work required of me to my highest standard possible. However I know that sometimes I can get fixated on this, leading me down a rabbit hole at times. It's knowing when I need to take a step back and refresh myself. This is something that I have been consciously and successfully doing while completing my EDA work.

Being Process Driven means I like formulating plans and milestones of how I will achieve the end goal. This as times and lead me to become a little controlling as deviating off path is not always bad, but might lead me to new discoveries of learning. I need to also keep accept that I will make mistakes as this is all part of learning too.</p> 



<h2>A commitment to how I’ll manage my workload in this program</h2>

<p>I am currently having some good success with my motivation despite the lockdown. I have planned my workloads around working for an hour and then allowing myself to take a break and do something I enjoy. Working out and taking our dog for a walk has been good in between working also. 

I would like to keep doing similar routines in the next few weeks, however I’m not sure with the workload increasing, if that is still is a viable option.

I am looking forward to starting in the class room as I'm definitely more of a hands on learner, being around others, bouncing ideas and thoughts with one another, and learning together was a huge reason I decided to study with EDA.

I feel like am able to voice my opinion when I feel have valid input but then also know when it is the right time to take the backseat.

Coming from my personal trainer background I know to never judge a book by its cover as people you never thought would will definitely surprise you.</p>



<h2>A commitment as to how I’ll seek help if and when the workload gets out of hand</h2>

<p>Time management in this respect I have struggled with over the last few days. I have noticed myself loosing track of time on a few tasks and only asked for help when I’m down the rabbit hole and completely stuck for an hour. 

To mitigate this, I will try setting a timer for 30 minutes when I know I’m struggling and when the timer goes off and I’m still struggling or stuck, I will reach out to the cohort or my facilitator.</p> 


<h2>hat I expect of the EDA Facilitator</h2>

<p>My expectations of my facilitator is that they’ll be happy and have good energy. I also hope they have the attitude that there are no dumb questions, as there will be a few from me.</p>


<h2>Any scheduling conflicts where I will be committed to other things</h2>

<p>No, I am fully committed to EDA and this takes my top priority.</p>
