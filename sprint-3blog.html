        <h1>Analogy</h1>

<p>If we wanted to make a birthday cake, first we would start with html. Html is our base ( our cake ). We then use CSS to decorate the cake with icing and sprinkles.</p> 

Control flow is the order in which we go about our day and the loops are what we repeat.

<h1>The Dom</h1>

<p>The DOM ( Document object model ) is an object orientated representation of your HTML document. A webpage is a document not matter if it is opened in a browser or in a code editor. We can use JavaScript to modify your HTML code via the DOM.</p>

<h1>Functions, Objects & Arrays</h1>

<p>There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot notation (.) and the bracket notation ( [ ] )
The Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you’re trying to access ahead of time.</p>

<p>Let myObject = {</p>
<p>property1: “value1”</p>
<p>property2: “value2”</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>Let propertyValue = myObject.property1</p>

<p>We can access the data from arrays using square brackets. We Choose what entry in the array we would like by placing a number between the square brackets, the first element in an array has an index of 0.</p>
<p>Let array = [50,60,70];</p>
<p>array[0] would be equal to 50</p>
<p>Let data = array[1] would be equal to 60</p>

<p>Functions are a sequence of commands that take and input and give us an output. They are important because they are reusable and save us from repeating code.</p>

<p>Function addNumber( num1, num2 ) {</p>
<p>     return num1 + num2</p>
<p> }</p>

<p>addNumber( 10, 15 )   </p>
