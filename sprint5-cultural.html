    <h1>Final Evaluation</h1>

    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>

    <p>Patients. The change from week two to the final week has been massive. Iv needed less time away from coding as
        the frustration of not knowing has turned into the desire to learn more.
        As a learner I have found that I have been more invested and have seen my understanding grow while working on my
        own code, rather than exercises like free code camp where you are just regurgitation someone else’s work.
        A big takeaway from the core work was looking at life from the perspective of the glass is half full.
        Reinforcing positive habits and mindset has been important to me as I like to be out and about. Being stuck at
        home by myself all day during lockdown was most definitely a struggle.</p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    <p>I fell like empathy and self awareness are very similar. Knowing what your strengths and weakness are. Using them
        to your advantage while learning is important. More so while on foundations when the bulk of your learning is
        user driven.
        Programming for me so far has definitely been a test challenge so far. I am used to asking a question when I
        didn’t know the answer but being challenged to research and find out for myself has helped with self belief and
        confidence.</p>


    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

    <p>There was a lot of things I read about during the core learning I had been instinctively doing with my client
        already.</p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

    <p>Writing my blog posts knowing everyone can read them!</p>

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
        development bootcamp course?</h2>

    <p>Obviously when finding a job as a coder being able to code is important but there is far more to a job than just
        the technical side of things. In a work environment you must work well collaboratively with your coworkers. Good
        communication leads to an increased level of productivity and generally higher levels of workplace moral.</p>


    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
        time to practicing programming instead?</h2>

    <p>The core exercises were a nice change of pace from the coding. There were times early on where things would be
        frustrating on the technical side and stepping back from that and thinking about learning and positive change
        really helped my mood and got me to refocus.
        It felt like there was a good balance of time spent on the core and tech parts tp foundations.</p>

    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

    <p>Long term I want to continue in property development. Money Is the driving factor that pushed me towards I.T.
        while in I.T. I would like to work towards a product owner type roll.</p>

    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

    <p>I feel pretty similar to what I wrote during sprint 2. I feel my strengths are that I am a clear communicator and
        work well in teams. I am comfortable taking criticism from others.
        Having worked on the tech side I now feel my biggest weakness will being able to keep up with all of the new
        information. Im generally a slow burner when it comes to technology. </p>

    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

    <p>Keeping up with the workload. I know we will be doing a lot of work in teams and I don’t want to let anyone down.
        I’m not the fastest coder at this point and that hasn’t been an issue during foundations as we’ve had a lot of
        time during lockdown.
        9 Weeks is a very short time!</p>

    <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>

    <p>I would like to work on my presentation skills. I have always been in front of people but when it comes to a more
        formal setting I have little experience. This will give me more confidence during the job interview process.</p>

    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>

    <p>I am really looking forward to bootcamp. I learn better in a group environment. Having others around me that I
        can talk to when feeling stuck will help me greatly.
        Having the facilitators in the room with me will be awesome. When working with a partner I plan to first discuss
        with them where I am lost. Failing that if anther group or facilitator if free ill check in with them.</p>

    <p>When working on a project I like to break it down into smaller goals. For example if something was expected to
        take a week to complete I would break it down into daily goals to check off.
        Respecting everyones questions and understanding we all work and learn at a different pace. This is important to
        help make everyone feel safe and comfortable in the learning environment.</p>
