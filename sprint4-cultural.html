<h1>
Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
</h1>

<h2>
How do you explain neuroplasticity?
</h2>

<p>
Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.

How Neuroplasticity has influenced my learning:
</h2>
<p>
The idea that we are able to rewire our brains has made a positive impact on how iv gone about my studies during bootcamp. I was always good at math and terrible at anything that involved literacy. Writing, spelling, grammar you name it I had written it off. 
Making a conscious effort to be mindful of unpleasant emotions while being stuck has helped m work through some very frustrating moments. 
A big take away for me was also learning is much more than just receiving new information and gaining knowledge. Its about the path of continuous growth. Its not all about the destination but how you get there.

Here is a video I found interesting while researching Neuroplasticity. It is about neuroplasticity and stroke patients. I have worked with a number of stroke patients over the years they provided some great moments for me.

<h2>
What is Growth Mindset:
</h2>

<p>
“In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort.” Carol Dweck

How Growth Mindset has influenced my learning:
</h2>
<p>
For as long as I can remember I have been a creature of habit. I always felt like this was a good thing but since I have started to read more about growth mindset I can see that it was stopping me from maximising my potential.
There has been many testing moments where iv had absolutely no idea what to do. Looking at it from a view point of I will be able to do this in the future and reminding myself to stay positive has kept my overall perspective positive. Enjoying this and looking forward to learning has made this whole process easier as I have found being stuck in lockdown really hard.
