<h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h2>
        A time I was blocked on a simple problem:
    </h2>

    <p>
        One on the challenges we were working on required us to create a function that took a string( a sentence ) and
        remove the word buzz from it. Some sentences contained the word multiple times.
        I worked through and was able to write the function to remove buzz but was stuck on the final test as the word
        buzz was written with capital letters. I thought maybe I could convert the text to all lower case but that also
        failed the test.
        I started by googling how I could check the word buzz without converting it all to lower case. I looked for a
        while with no luck. I then called my girlfriend to take to her about it( she knows nothing about coding just
        needed a vent). While talking to her I realised I could use an if statement and that if the word was changed to
        lower case was not equal to buzz return the word.
        I found this process surprisingly funny. I felt like I had done the hard part and now I was stuck on something
        simple I should of been faster to pick up.
        What I learn’t from this process was a better understanding of built in methods and functions.
        I had spent the extra time googling than I otherwise would. Also came across arrow functions and I started to
        read there.

    <h2>
        A time I solved a problem in an elegant way:
    </h2>

    <p>
        I’m not sure there is anything particularly elegant about my code at the moment so ill write about when I solved
        a problem confidently.
        During the same challenge as above we had to take a string and return it with the first letter of each word
        changed to a capital.
        I started the task by writing a list of small steps I needed to achieve and decided that after each step I would
        use console.log to check if I was on the right path.
        This was my favourite task as I was able to complete it without getting stuck for to long at each point. It gave
        me a great deal of confidence as it felt like the hard work was sinking in.
        What I learnt was to not get to cocky. I came off this task thinking I had cracked it to spend about 3 hours on
        the following task.

    <h2>
        Problem solving techniques:
    </h2>

    <p>
        There have been some techniques I have used more than others and I feel that might be because they are more
        intuitive. I was quick to turn to google and ask my facilitator for help.
        After spending more time on the katas, I found that console.log was probably the most important tool I had at
        this stage and when I was moving nicely it was something I was using often.Pseudocode and the rubber ducky
        technique are also techniques I’m starting to see value in. I think in the next sprint I will start the
        minesweeper task by writing pseudocode.
        Reflection and asking my peers for help are the two I have done less on. I felt like I didn’t want to distract
        my peers from their study but in reality them helping me would probably help them cement their knowledge.
